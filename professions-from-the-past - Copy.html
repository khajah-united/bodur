The Shepherd (Al-Shawi)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
Al-Shawi was one of the traditional Kuwaiti professions, namely sheep herding. The shepherd gathered the sheep from the families of the neighborhood (Fereej), and each Fereej had its own shepherd. He collected them in the morning to take them outside the city wall of Kuwait. After gathering sheep from each household, the most important thing the shepherd relied on was his donkey, used to carry his needs inside a "Kharj," a burlap sack for food and supplies. He also placed newborn goats inside it if needed. Shawi Athbiya was considered one of the most famous shepherds in the Jibla district. Another well-known figure was Shawi Al-Matabba, remembered for a popular chant he sang to children upon his arrival:

Ice Seller
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
Ice was precious and rare, and obtaining ice blocks was difficult because priority was given to cafés, fishermen, and ice shops. In alleys near homes and places where passersby gathered, the seller placed ice blocks wrapped in burlap to prevent melting. Ice was sold by weight, and each buyer carried a small container to keep the ice from melting.

Cotton Cleaner (Naddaf)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The Naddaf, also called Mudarrib or Qattan, was responsible for cleaning and sorting cotton or wool to make mattresses, covers, and quilts. Before cotton, wool from sheep was used to stuff cushions and mattresses. The Naddaf transformed compressed cotton full of impurities into soft, clean cotton using a bow to purify it. Demand for the Naddaf increased during holidays and weddings to prepare new mattresses and cushions for guests. He began by stripping cotton from its old fabric, spreading it on mats under the sun to ease cleaning and loosening. Using a wooden rod (Mudarab) striking a thick string on the tool (Tanja), the process produced a soothing sound while separating impurities. The cotton returned to its natural white color, then was sewn into new fabric with hand needles and cotton threads.

Jleeb Ankham (Well Cleaners)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
This phrase consists of two words: "Jleeb," meaning well, and "Ankham," meaning to sweep or clean. Together it meant cleaning wells of dirt and impurities. This profession was carried out by two men, often one of them blind. They roamed the streets calling out "Jleeb Ankham" while carrying ropes, buckets, and sometimes ladders. Families with wells or water reservoirs needing cleaning would hire them, especially if an animal had fallen in and died, making the water impure. The blind man descended into the well to clean and remove the water, while his partner stayed above to assist. The blindness was seen as an advantage, as he would not be frightened by insects or creatures inside. After finishing, they were paid and moved on to seek other work.

The Millstone Repairer (Nakkas)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The Nakkas was the craftsman who repaired household millstones. He walked through neighborhoods calling "Nakkas... Nakkas" to announce his service. The millstone consisted of two stone pieces, the upper one with a hole for pouring wheat, rotated by a wooden handle. Over time, the stone became smooth and ineffective. The Nakkas roughened and repaired it using his tools carried in a bag: hammers, chisels, and files. By chiseling and striking the stone, he restored its teeth so it could grind wheat again. This was an essential service for families who relied on millstones to prepare their food.

Kandari
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The word "Kandar" means fresh water, but linguistically it comes from the Kanara language. "Kanar" refers to the jujube tree, and "Dar" means stick, shortened to "Kandar." It was a curved, flexible stick with two pointed ends, from which two tins (similar to date or kerosene cans) were hung. The Kandari carried water using this stick balanced on his shoulders, with the tins dangling on each side. The Kandari profession was essential for transporting fresh water to homes and provided a livelihood for many families.

    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The Bazzaz was the cloth seller, offering fabrics and garments. In the past, he would walk through neighborhoods, sometimes on foot and sometimes with his donkey, calling out his goods. Women would come out to buy fabrics of their choice. Later, this trade moved into shops and stalls.

Herbalist (Hawaj / Attar)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The Attar, also called Hawaj locally, was the herbalist who sold special wild plants, grains, dried fruits, and fruit peels such as pomegranate and orange. These were mainly used in traditional medicine. He also sold spices, seeds, and materials for dyes. The Attar was often skilled in mixing herbs and remedies, some imported from India, Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait’s desert. Items included thyme, basil, borage, ginger, dried lime, anise, henna, cardamom pods, and sidr leaves. There was no dedicated market for herbalists; they were spread across Kuwait’s markets.

Barber (Al-Muhassin / Al-Muzayyin)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
Barbering was an old profession that evolved over time. The barber was called "Al-Muzayyin" and spent his entire day working. Haircuts were mandatory, especially for children, who had their heads shaved weekly. The price was half a rupee for children and one rupee for adults. Most customers had their heads shaved completely, while some requested specific styles. The barber’s tools included a razor (Mous), a small bowl (Tasa), a razor sharpener, cloth pieces, and soap for washing hair before cutting. Barbers also shaved or trimmed beards. Some barbers acted as folk doctors, treating certain ailments due to their skill with the razor.

Leatherworker (Al-Kharraz)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
Leather stitching and decoration was the craft of the Kharraz. It is an old traditional profession that still exists today. The leatherworker skillfully handled hides and transformed them into useful items for daily life. Products included sandals, water skins, milk containers, oil flasks, gun covers, and belts.

Shellfish Seller (Zubabeet)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
The "Zuboot" was a type of marine shell, conical in shape, containing a small mollusk removed using a palm frond spine. A proverb "Zuboot Al-Naqaa" referred to anything small in size. These shells were boiled in pots and sold cooked. Vendors in the streets near the fish market called out "Big and fresh Zubabeet" and also sold "Hawita," a small ribbed shell with a tiny mollusk inside, also cooked and eaten.

Mullah’s School (Bayt Al-Mutawwa)
    </h2>
 <p class="text-lg">
Before the establishment of the Department of Education and the spread of government schools in Kuwait, there were private schools teaching the Qur’an, Islamic studies, reading, writing, calligraphy, and arithmetic. These were supervised by a teacher called the Mullah or Mutawwa, assisted by other teachers. The school was usually a small old house owned or rented cheaply by the Mullah, furnished with mats, water jars, wooden boards for writing, and the Mullah’s chair. Parents brought their children and negotiated fees: some paid monthly wages called "Mashahra," while others agreed on a lump sum called "Qatou’a," paid after completing the Qur’an.
