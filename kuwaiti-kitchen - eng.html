    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-center">Kuwaiti Kitchen</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      From the beginning I was interested in cooking. My favorite game was with the remains of small pots and utensils my mother did not use. I took a corner of the house to imitate what I used to see and felt it was the identity of the lady of the house. I lived in a home that loved food and distinguished it. My grandmother was known for Kuwaiti Jareesh and passed it down to my mother. When you taste it, even among many dishes, you could tell it was my mother’s Jareesh. At that time I felt as if dishes were honorary medals awarded to women. She did not only excel in that dish but in all dishes. As they say, my mother herself was sweet in cooking, and thank God I inherited a share of that. We also grew up listening to Professor Fatima Hussein and her programs. She was the first to document Kuwaiti cuisine in a book until it became one of the important necessities for students abroad.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      That interest continued until I reached the master’s stage. My thesis was about food titled "When Food Becomes Identity: Cultural Dimensions in Anime Films – Hayao Miyazaki." Part of it was an extension of my love for food and its preparation, another part was our connection to anime films we watched in our childhood and the details of preparing meals and their variety, and thirdly the richness of Japanese culture in that matter. From this perspective my jealousy for our culture and the authenticity of Kuwaiti cuisine increased, searching between its lines for many values, diversity, development, and refined taste until I had in my hands a unique book on Kuwaiti cuisine titled "Kuwaiti Cuisine: Heritage and History of Peoples" by Professor Suad Radi. That book opened new horizons and gave great hope that dishes could be seen as history and identity in Kuwaiti cuisine.
      <br><br>
      From this perspective Kuwaiti cuisine had great importance and a door that reached my feelings and formed an image of my cultural identity. I wanted it to remain stable and reliable in any way to convey to the world those simple corners that were in old houses and fed many mouths of families and guests. That corner created women who carried on their chests all the medals of love and appreciation. Therefore I will speak about Kuwaiti cuisine from my heart before my mind, and Kuwaiti cuisine will be seen with completely different eyes than what we are used to.
      The reference "The Old Kuwaiti House, compiled by Mohammed Al-Khars and Maryam Rashid Al-Aqroqa, 1999" had great merit in forming a clear perception of the parts of the old Kuwaiti house, especially in the details of the Kuwaiti kitchen, which helped me reimagine those places loaded with memories.

History of Kuwaiti Kitchen and Its Tools:
    </h2>

    <p class="text-lg">
     The Kuwaiti kitchen went through multiple stages until we reached what we have today, mainly linked to the design of the place, the tools, and the availability of food materials and seasonings.
</p>
 <p class="text-lg text-center">
    Architectural Design of the Kuwaiti Kitchen:
</p>

<p class="text-lg">
The Kuwaiti house consists of several courtyards (open spaces with built parts), including the Diwaniya courtyard dedicated only to men, the Haram courtyard for the family, and the kitchen courtyard with its facilities such as a place for animals, a room for them to sleep in winter, the Dar Al-Keil or Al-Jeel (a storage room for food supplies), the fuel room (for storing fuel materials), and a sandy yard with a well (Jleeb) in the middle and a food drain. I will discuss these facilities in detail later, but first we will talk about the kitchen room.

It is a copper stove of varying sizes, consisting of a kerosene tank fixed with three stands topped by a metal grid on which the pot to be heated is placed. On the side of the tank there is an opening with a pump that compresses air, pushing kerosene through a tube to the ignition head under the metal grid. When the flame weakened due to kerosene blockage, a special needle called "Primus needle" was inserted into the ignition eye and removed, quickly restoring the strong flame. It was mostly used to heat water.

Dar Al-Keil:
    </h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
The name of this room comes from "Keila" (Persian J pronunciation), which is a container used to measure grains and similar items. Women used it to determine how many measures of rice were needed for a meal. It could be made of copper, aluminum, or even an empty tin can. In my family, inherited from my grandmother to my mother and then to us, it was always a canned pineapple tin of a specific brand, used to measure rice. It was always found in the rice sack made of jute — natural fibers extracted from the jute plant in tropical regions — or in the flour or lentil sack, serving as the standard measure for the household.
I heard many funny and sad stories about this room, especially in large family houses. It was mentioned in many old Kuwaiti tales. The aunt or housewife would lock the room and hang the key around her neck to prevent anyone from entering and wasting supplies. More than that, there was a wooden chest known as "Sahara Al-Keil" (in Kuwaiti dialect the letter K becomes Persian J, pronounced like CH in English). This chest, found in some houses, was large and deep, about 1.5 to 3 meters long, with a lid and lock. It usually contained dates, flour, salt, sugar, fat, spices, and some kitchen tools and utensils not used daily. The key was always with the housewife, and if she was extra cautious, the chest could even be moved into the bedroom.

It was also possible to store in that room some animal feed for the sheep courtyard, and dates packed in "Qulla," which were made from palm fronds (Khasaf) stacked on top of each other. Sometimes date syrup would drip onto the ground, making the room suitable for insects and rodents, which made it frightening for some. It also contained sacks of rice and legumes.

Palm Fronds:
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">
It is the palm branches with leaves, and "Sa'af" is the plural of "Sa'fa." Before drying, the frond is divided into several parts: the "Jareed" or "Kafoud," which is the whole frond when the leaves and thorns are removed (singular: Jareeda). There was a popular children’s game called "Kafoud" because it was made from this material. The other parts are the leaves, Karab, thorns, and Lif. Bedouins called it "Aseeb," plural "Usub" or "Usban," which is a classical Arabic term. Palm branches were imported from neighboring countries by ships, dried, and used as fuel.

Kerosene was first used for lighting and to help ignite firewood, then used in heaters (Bukhari) and industrial stoves. There were various types that ran on kerosene, called "Kaz Joula," with a thick cotton wick ending in the fuel tank.

Jleeb (Well) and Food Drain:
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">
It was a cement basin built in the corner of the courtyard near the kitchen, used for washing hands and household utensils. Food residues mixed with wash water would flow into a covered pit nearby, made specifically for this purpose so they would not mix with other waste water. Linguistically, "Balou’a" means a hole made for draining water, or a channel in the house where dirty water flows. In dialect, "Zad" means food. The food drain was separated so that food residues would not mix with other waste from the toilets attached to the house.
